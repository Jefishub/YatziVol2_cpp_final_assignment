Yatzy Vol 2 - by Jere Manni

This game popped into my mind when I was playing DnD with my friends and I had a lot of different dices in my hand.
The basic idea is exactly the same as in Yatzy, but you will not play with 5 d6 dices, instead with:d4 , d6, d8, d12 and d20.
This changes the probabilities alot and makes yatzy almost impossible. I have not yet checked out the numbers.
The different dices also makes the game more strategic since you have different probability with different dice.

For example:    Throwing a 6 with d6 (like in normal yatzy) is not as good as throwing the 6 with d20.
                This is because after getting a 6 with d20, it is unlikely you will get another 6 with d20.
                However, if you get 6 with d20, the chances are fairly high to get it with d6.

The mechanics will be pretty much the same as in regular yatzy. I might have to tweak out some multipliers to compensate difficulty levels.
For example getting 4 same is super hard compared to regular yatzy. So I might give a multiplier of say 3 or 4 when you get 4 same.

Also getting a small/large straight might be different in this game. Maybe it is gonna be small straight with 3 dice, medium with 4 dice, large 5 dice.



concepts:

- Starting screen
- You must see the yatzy table and it's content (aka thrown results so far)
- throw button
- quit/exit game function
- randomizing dices throws
- showing throw results
- decorated outputs for dice results
- selecting dices to keep and throw
- Adding acceptable result to the table (manually written/chosen?)
- ending game -> showing end result
- Play again / quit game
